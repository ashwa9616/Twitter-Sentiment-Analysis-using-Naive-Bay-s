# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Naive-Bay-s
Objective: Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using Naive Bayes algorithm.

Steps:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of tweets with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral) or label them manually.
Data Preprocessing: Clean tweets by removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and emojis. Tokenize and lowercase the text.
Feature Extraction: Convert preprocessed text into numerical features using techniques like Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF.
Model Training: Implement Naive Bayes classifier from scratch or using libraries like scikit-learn. Train the model on the labeled tweet dataset.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
